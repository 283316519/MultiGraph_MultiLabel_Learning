# Multi-Graph Multi-Label Learning

The details of `MGML` can be found in the following papers:

*Zhu, Z.; Zhao, Y.	Multi-Graph Multi-Label Learning Based on Entropy. Entropy 2018, 20, 245.* [[pdf](/entropy-20-00245.pdf)]

Innovative algorithm `ESM` mentioned in the paper could be found [here](/ESM).

Unfortunately, since we used some pioneers' codes, `Graph Segment`, `MIML-ELM` and `MIML-SVM` cannot be public due to confidentiality agreement.

However, I rewrote some of them to realize `MGML` Learning and all these codes can be used freely as long as you follow the [license](/LICENSE). Although the effectiveness and efficiency cannot be guaranteed as well as in the paper, you can still experience our advanced `MGML` algorithm!
