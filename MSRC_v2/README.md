# MSRC v2

MSRC v2 is a subset of the Microsoft Research Cambridge (MSRC) image data set. It contains 591 images and 23 classes of labels. About 80% of images belong to more than 1 label and there are about 3 labels per image on average.

`Images` is from the [original data set website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/image-understanding/), and `newsegmentations_mats` is from the [cleaned-up version](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tmalisie/projects/bmvc07/).

The MATLAB script `Extract_MSRC_v2_Label.m` is used to extract labels of MSRC v2 into one file: `MSRC_v2_label`.
